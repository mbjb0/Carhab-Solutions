This code is not functional past the classification step, and even then
I'm not entirely sure it still works. You are going to have to do a lot of rewriting
and all of it depends on the libraries and yolo classes of yolov5 v5.0. If you are going to
upgrade the yolo version I would recommend rewriting classification entirely.
For reference this code corresponds with the last succesful running of a yolo model on the
TX2, before it crashed.
