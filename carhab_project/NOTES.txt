I have gotten about as far as I can get without having the car.
Uncomment out the import and Instruction class uses on main to test running on the car.
Set debug to 0 to actually move the car wheels.
I have no idea if any of the libraries or my logic loops actually work but it should provide
good placeholder code to give an idea of what we should be doing.
We should probably also replace the model. If you train, or just find a better trained model online
you can just replace best.pt and change the classes in init__ for driving_logic.
Currently I am using German sign dataset, print out some of the signs on dataset-card to test.
It is much better at the triangular signs.

The model is especially bad at telling left from right signs. I think this has to do with the default
yolo training having a random flip transform, so if we train our own model make sure to disable that.
